# Odin Calculator

## Description
This is my implementation of the calculator final project for the Odin Project's Foundations course.

It's definitely a little on the spaghetti side of things given how many nested if / else if / else statements are crammed into the event handlers, but I'm decently happy with the functionality. (And not too upset with how it looks, either.)

I've left javaScript math imprecision unhandled as that seems out of scope for the assignment.

It works similarly to a classic scientific calculator but with only arithmetic operations.
